\section{Method} \label{sec:method}
The optimization of power regulation while minimizing loads, requires a model that can predict the power output and the loads of a wind farm. This section describes how this is implemented.

An overview of the optimization procedure used is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:optim}.
The power output of a wind farm as well as the wake propagation in this wind farm are calculated using the FLORIS model \cite{Gebraad2016} (Section \ref{sec:floris}). Given a certain wind field the program FAST calculates bending moments on the root of the turbine blades. The program MLife is used to convert these bending moments into short-term Damage Equivalent Loads (DELs). These will be used for damage comparison of the flow profiles \cite{MLife}. Both FAST and MLife are covered in Section \ref{sec:fast}. These DELs are precalculated for different situations and stored in a lookup table so it can be quickly retrieved during optimization (Section \ref{sec:lut}). The optimization algorithm uses a cost function that combines the DEL and power data to find the optimal wind turbine configuration that has minimal loads while tracking a predefined reference power (Section \ref{sec:optimization}).

\subsection{FLORIS} \label{sec:floris} The FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady state (FLORIS) model is used to simulate the wind flow in a wind farm while also generating power output data. The model works as a function of the yaw misalignment and the axial induction \cite{Gebraad2016}. FLORIS is a parametric model fitted to high-fidelity data from a computational fluid dynamics simulation, making it a relative accurate model with low computation time \cite{Dijk2016}. 

\subsubsection{Wake modelling}
\label{wakemodel}
%As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:wake}, 
FLORIS contains a wake model which divides the wake into three different zones as shown in Figure \ref{fig:wake}. These zones are denoted by $q_i$ and defined as the near wake ($q$=1), the far wake ($q$=2) and the mixing zone ($q$=3). Each zone has its own function for the zone diameter and wind speed, which are calculated by FLORIS using Equations \ref{eq:Dw} to \ref{eq:c}. 


\begin{figure}
  	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./Figures/WakeFLORIS.png}
  	\caption{Simplified top view representation of a wake of a turbine by FLORIS\cite{Gebraad2016}.}
	\label{fig:wake}
\end{figure}

The diameter sizes of the wake zones are calculated using Equation \ref{eq:Dw}. Let the $D_i$ denote the rotor diameter of the $i${\textsuperscript{th}} turbine, $k_e$ a coefficient that describes expansion of the zones, and $m_{e,q}$, the expansion factor as used by Gebraad \cite{Gebraad2016}. The diameter size of third wake zone $D_{w,q,i=3}$ is frequently used further in this paper. Therefor to increase readability, this diameter will be referred to as 'wake diameter' or $D_w$. This diameter $D_w$ increases proportionally with downwind distance $x$ (for orientation see Figure \ref{fig:wake}).
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Dw}
D_{w,i,q}(x) = max({D_i + 2k_em_{e,q}([x - X_i],0} )
\end{equation}
The velocity in the wake is related to this downwind distance $x$ as well, see Equation \ref{eq:Uw}. Here the wake velocity is an argument of the wake decay coefficient $c_{i,q}(x)$ and the axial induction factor $a_i$. The axial induction factor is a measure for the wind speed reduction behind a turbine relative to its own rotor speed. The wake decay coefficient describes the decay of velocity for each wake zone and is defined in Equation \ref{eq:c}. In this equation, the coefficients $m_{U,q}$ are parameters that define the wake decay for the wake different zones \cite{Gebraad2016}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Uw}
U_{w,i}(x,y) = U_i\left( {1-2a_{i}c_{i,q}(x)} \right)
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:c}
c_{i,q}(x) = \left[ \frac{D_i}{D_i + 2k_em_{U,q}(\gamma_i)[x - X_i]} \right]^2
\end{equation}

\subsection{FAST \& MLife} \label{sec:fast} FAST is a dynamic turbine model \cite{Jonkman2005}. Among others, it computes the root out of plane bending moments (RootMOops) of turbine blades. RootMOops cyclically change with the blades orientation in the wind, which is a function of the turbines turning frequency. Compiling the RootMOops as a function of time gives a load spectrum.

This paper uses the program MLife to convert these load spectra into short-term damage equivalent loads (DELs). A DEL is a constant amplitude fatigue-load, for which a frequency is defined that is kept equal for all load spectra. This makes it possible to compare the different load spectra through the DELs, which are independent of other factors \cite{Wilson2017, MLife}. All simulations are performed on the NREL offshore 5-MW baseline wind turbine \cite{Jonkman2005}.

\subsubsection{Flow field} \label{sec:flowfield}
The wind flow that falls on the turbine blades are the input FAST uses to calculate the loads. This is a 2-dimensional grid containing wind velocity data at the location of the wind turbine rotor-plane.

This study made this wind data more representative for real life by implementing both a more realistic wake distribution, the Gaussian distribution, as well as natural phenomena, the shear effect.

\paragraph{Gaussian wake}
FLORIS describes a discrete flow field of a wake, with three zones. The flow field of the wake in FLORIS is calculated with equations (\ref{eq:Dw} to \ref{eq:c}). The wake is divided into three zones as described in section \ref{wakemodel}. A real wake, however, does not have these discrete zones. To create a more fluent transition between the different wake-zones, a Gaussian distribution of the flow field is introduced \cite{Bastankhah2016}. The wake shape difference can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:disgaus}.  The Gaussian distribution is calculated as follows: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gaus}
G(y, z) = A e^{-\left(\frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y} + \frac{z^2}{2\sigma_z}\right)}
\end{equation}
The amplitude of the Gaussian, $A$, is equal to the velocity loss of the inner wake zone, $U_{w,1}$, as generated by FLORIS. $\sigma_y$ and $\sigma_z$ reflect the Gaussian standard deviation in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively. These standard deviations are related wake diameter $D_{w}$ following Equation \ref{eq:sigm},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sigm}
\sigma_y,\sigma_z = \frac{D_{w}}{n} 
\end{equation}
\\
Where fit parameter $n$ can be modified to change the width of the Gaussian. Consequently, making it possible to fit a Gaussian to the wake zones of FLORIS (Figure \ref{fig:disgaus}). Future versions of FLORIS will have this Gaussian distribution implemented as well. 

\paragraph{Wind shear} \label{sec:windshear}
Another aspect added to improve the accuracy of the wind data is wind shear. This natural phenomenon is the result of earths surface slowing the wind down closer to the ground. This results in a significant difference in wind speed over the height ranges of the turbine, which has a significant effect on the DELs \cite{Firtin2011}.  The velocity distribution is calculated as follows: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:shear}
v = v_{ref} \left[\frac{h}{h_{ref}}\right]^\alpha
\end{equation}
Here $v$ and $v_{ref}$ are the velocity at heights $h$, and $h_{ref}$  respectively. Value $\alpha$ is the wind shear coefficient which depends on different factors. The coefficient $\alpha$  reflects terrain type, and is for this paper fixed at value 0.1 representing a surface close to ocean and smooth ground \cite{Firtin2011}. Figure \ref{fig:windshear} shows the flow fields of a wake both before and after the implementation of shear.

\subsection{Lookup table} \label{sec:lut}
To reduce computational time during optimization the DELs are precalculated for a wide variety of wind field conditions and stored in a lookup table.

The loads on a wind turbine can be approximated as a function of the parameters $D_w$, $U_{fs}$, $\gamma$ and $y_{C2C}$. These parameters are varied in simulations to calculate the DELs for every situation needed. The minimum value, maximum value and step size chosen for each parameters can be seen in Table \ref{tab:pars}. This results in a 4-dimensional matrix containing 6426 DELs. To estimate a DEL on a turbine, the value of each parameter is retrieved from FLORIS and used to linearly interpolate in the lookup table.

The Gaussian wake, as described in Equation \ref{eq:gaus}, is fully defined by $D_w$, $U_{fs}$. Downstream distance $x$ can be calculated with $D_w$ by rewriting Equation \ref{eq:Dw}. The amplitude $A$ can then be calculated with Equations \ref{eq:Uw} and \ref{eq:c}. Standard deviations $\sigma_y$ and $\sigma_z$ follow from Equation \ref{eq:sigm}. Since FLORIS only considers the wake behavior at the hub height of the wind turbines, the z-location of the wake center is placed at that height. The center-to-center distance $y_{C2C}$ determines the y-location of the wake center. With this information an entire flow field, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:windshear}, is defined. The flow field together with yaw angle $\gamma$ are used as input for FAST. The range of each parameter is chosen so that all required situations are included within the lookup table.

%\noindent
\subsection{Optimization} \label{sec:optimization}
For the optimization, a trade-off has to be made between power regulation and load minimization. This trade-off is defined in a cost function \cite{Dijk2016, Marden2013}, which is minimized using a game-theoretic approach \cite{Marden2013}. The goal is to find the optimal turbine configuration, meaning yaw and axial induction settings for each turbine.
 

\subsubsection{Cost Function} \label{sec:costfunction}

A mixed-objective cost function is used that tracks a predefined reference power while minimizing the DELs: 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
J(P,DEL) = \delta\left(\frac{P_{ref}-\sum\nolimits_i P_i(a_i,\gamma_i)}{P_{bw}}\right)^2 \\ +
 (1-\delta)\frac{\sum\nolimits_i DEL_i(a_i,\gamma_i)}{DEL_\text{{base}}}
\end{aligned}
 \label{eq:costf}
\end{equation}
Here $\delta$ is the tuning parameter defining the relative importance of the power and loads optimization objectives. $P_i(a_i,\gamma_i)$ and $DEL_i(a_i,\gamma_i)$ are respectively the power and DEL of the $i^{th}$ turbine. $P_{ref}$ is the reference power, which is desired power output of the wind farm that the power regulation objective wishes to obtain. $P_{bw}$ and $DEL_{base}$ are the power and loads baselines respectively  that are used to create normalized variables.


\subsubsection{Game Theory} \label{sec:gametheory}
The game-theoretic approach uses random perturbations on the yaw angles and the axial induction factors to minimize the cost function. When new values for yaw and axial induction settings give an improvement regarding the cost function, the settings are saved and the process will be repeated with new settings. Because it uses random perturbations, the game theoretic approach is an adequate optimizer to find the global minimum of the cost function \cite{Dijk2016}.

\subsection{Case studies}
\label{sec:Case studies}
The goal of the optimization, as specified in Section \ref{sec:optimization}, is to track a reference power $P_{ref}$, while minimizing the DELs of the wind farm. Different cases are run to verify if the model can achieve this goal. First the currently used Greedy control method is simulated as a reference. In the cases hereafter $P_{ref}$ is varied as a percentage of a maximum possible power.

For the Greedy control method the yaw angles are set to zero and the axial induction factors to one third. 

A case was run to determine the maximum possible power that can be extracted from the wind farm under the conditions used. The tuning parameter $c$ is set to one and $P_{ref}$ to a value known to be above the maximum possible power. 

The actual reference tracking cases are run with tuning parameter $c = 0.5$, varying $P_{ref}$ as a percentage of the above mentioned maximum power. These cases are evaluated for their ability to preform reference tracking as well as their percentile reduction of DELs. The results of these simulations can be found in section \ref{sec:Simulation cases}.

For every simulation the following optimization settings were used: $P_{bw} = 0.05 MW$, $DEL_{base} = 5.35E6$ and 50.000 iterations.
