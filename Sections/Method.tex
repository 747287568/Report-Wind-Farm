\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

	To realize active power control and minimizing loads by yaw control and axial induction, it is necessary to know the effects of different flow conditions on the total power of the wind farm and the effect of different flow conditions on the loads for each of the turbine. Moreover, there need to be an optimizer which executes the optimization to approach a set value for the power and to minimize the loads.\newline
	The total power of the wind farm is calculated with the FLORIS-model. Besides, FLORIS is able to adjust the turbine configurations, the axial induction and yaw position.  
	The effect of the wind flow on a turbine, regarding the loads, are given by the programs FAST and MLife. The output of these programs are Damage Equivalent Load values (DELs), which are a measure of equivalent load damage to the turbine concerning the material properties.\cite{Chougule2016} These DELs are calculated for a different set of wind and turbine conditions and are stored in a look-up table(LUT).

	
	The optimizer takes the desired power production of the wind farm as an input. It used the configurations of the turbines from FLORIS to find the corresponding DEL values in the look-up table. If the configurations of the turbines are an improvement compared to the previous one, i.e. a improved power control or a reduce in the loads, FLORIS will save this turbine configurations. An overview of the optimization procedure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:optim}.

\subsection{FLORIS} The FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady state (FLORIS) model calculates the power of the wind farm as a function of the yaw misalignment and the axial induction. \cite{Gebraad2016}
FLORIS is a relative accurate\cite{Dijk2016} and a low computation model, due to the fact that it uses high-fidelity data from a computational fluid dynamics simulation. 

\subsubsection{Wake modelling}
\label{wakemodel}
As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:wake}, FLORIS  contains a wake model which divides the wake in different zones: the near wake, the far wake, and  the mixing zone, $q = 1$, $q = 2$, and $q = 3$ respectively. Each zone has its own diameter and wind speed, which are calculated by FLORIS.(\ref{eq:Dw} to \ref{eq:Uw}). 
\begin{figure}
  	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./Figures/WakeFLORIS.png}
  	\caption{Simplified top view representation of a wake of a turbine by FLORIS.\cite{Gebraad2016}   }
	\label{fig:wake}
\end{figure}
\\
Let $D_i$ denote the rotor diameter of the $i${\textsuperscript{th}} turbine, $k_e$ a coefficient that describes expansion of the zones , and $m_{e,q}$ the expansion factor which are calculated by Gebraad.\cite{Gebraad2016}. The size of the wake diameter $D_{w,q,i}$ increases proportionally to  the downwind distance ($x$). The diameter of the wake diameter is computed by,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Dw}
D_{w,i,q}(x) = max({D_i + 2k_em_{e,q}([x - X_i],0} )
\end{equation}
Also the velocity depends on the downwind distance $(x)$, which is an argument of the wake decay coefficient $c(x,y)$.\ref{eq:Uw}. This wake decay coefficient is multiplied by the axial induction factor and subtracted from the free stream velocity $U_i$. The axial induction factor is a value for the decrease in wind velocity behind a turbine relative to its own rotor speed. The wake decay coefficient describes the decay of velocity for each wake zone and is defined in \ref{eq:c}. The model parameter $M_{U,q}$, which depends on the wake zone and the yaw angle, is calculated by Gebraad.\cite{Gebraad2016}   

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Uw}
U_{w,i}(x,y) = U_i\left( {1-2a_ic_i(x,y)} \right)
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:c}
c_{i,q}(x) = \left[ \frac{D_i}{D_i + 2k_em_{U,q}(\gamma_i)[x - X_i]} \right]^2
\end{equation}

\subsection{FAST \& MLife} FAST is a programming tool for the simulation of dynamic (load) responses of wind turbines (by NREL) \cite{Jonkman2005}. It uses wind turbine specifications as well as wind flow situations. By evaluating a flow field, FAST computes the bending moment of a blade. Since the bending moment of a blade does not give direct information about the effect on the life-cycle time of a turbine, the program MLife is used to convert the bending moment to damage equivalent loads (DELs).

  \label{fig:disgaus}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Inflow files, Flow field} FLORIS describes a discrete flow field of a wake, with three zones. The flow field of the wake in FLORIS is calculated with equations ((\ref{eq:Dw} to \ref{eq:Uw})). The wake is divided into three zones as described in paragraph \ref{wakemodel}. A real wake will not have discrete zones, but a more fluent transition between the wake zones. To create a more fluent transition between the different wake-zones a Gaussian distribution of the flow field is preferred \cite{Bastankhah2016}.The difference of wake shape between a Gaussian and discrete shape can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:disgaus}.  The Gaussian distribution is calculated as followed, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gaus}
G(y, z) = A [e^{-(\frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y} + \frac{z^2}{2\sigma_z})}]
\end{equation}
where the amplitude of the Gaussian, A, is equal to the velocity loss of the inner wake zone, $U_{w,1}$, which is calculated with equation \ref{eq:Uw}. $\sigma_y$ and $\sigma_z$ reflect the Gaussian standard deviation in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively. The standard deviations are related to the outer wake zone $D_{w,i,q=3}$ which is given in \ref{eq:sigm},
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sigm}
\sigma_y,\sigma_z = D_{w,i,q=3}/n 
\end{equation}
\\
Where $n$ can be modified to change the width of the Gaussian. Consequently, it is possible to fit the Gaussian to the wake zones of Gebraad. (Figure \ref{fig:disgaus})


\subsection{Wind shear}
Wind shear can cause an important difference in velocity speeds between the rotor hub height, the end of the rotor blades at their highest points and the end of the rotor blades at their lowest point \cite{Firtin2011}.  The velocity distribution is calculated with, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:shear}
v = v_{ref} \left[\frac{h}{h_{ref}}\right]^\alpha
\end{equation}
where $v$ and $v_{ref}$ are the velocity at heights $h$, and $h_{ref}$  respectively. Value $\alpha$ is the wind shear coefficient which depends on different factors. Coefficient $\alpha$ is fixed at value 0.1, reflecting a terrain type close to ocean and smooth ground \cite{Firtin2011}. The wind shear is implemented in the flow field. The difference between a flow field with and without wind shear can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:windshear}

\subsection{LUT}
 To reduce computational time during optimization a look-up table (LUT) is created. The LUT is created using FAST and MLife, and it contains a a large number of DEL values for a wide variety of wind field conditions on a wind turbine.
These different conditions are described by the ranges of the parameters, which can be seen in Table \ref{tab:pars}. The parameters are wake characteristics which can be extracted from FLORIS. The parameters chosen for the LUT are:\begin{itemize}
	\item the free stream wind speed, U
	\item the outer diameter of the wake, Dwake
	\item the yaw of the turbine, yaw  
	\item the center to center distance between the turbine and the wake, y wake 
\end{itemize}   
 To save calculation time, the LUT parameters are discretized, given each parameter a certain step-size. This step-size is chosen such that interpolation will give a representative result. For each parameters step-sizes are selected, as shown in Table \ref{tab:pars}. With the use of the pre-calculated LUT, online optimization can be realized.

\textit{parameter choises:} The Yaw parameter accounts for changes in DELs as a result of yawing the turbine. this parameter was chosen since implementing this effect was one of the main goals of this paper. The other 3 parameters are used to caractarise the flowprofiles in the wakes. Every wake can be caracterised by its size, location, flow profile and one known wind speed.

The relative speeds in a wake can be extracted from its size and the gausian flow profile. The absolute windspeed in the wake can then be found by linking these relativeflowprofile to one known windspeed, the U of the free stream. The outer diameter of the wake ,the Dwake, was used as the parameter for the size, and can be fitted for every turbine within a range between ... and ... meter downwind of the upwind turbine.

The location information required for this reasearch is the relative location of wake compared to the downwind turbine. y wake gives the relative location of the center of the wake compared to the center of the downwind turbine. Hight ofset was not jet taken into account.

\subsection{Optimization}
To optimize for power reference tracking and load minimization, a game-theoretic approach was used.\cite{Marden2013} The optimization algorithm searches for the optimal yaw and axial induction settings of each individual turbine. These can influence the power and loads significantly, so both are combined in a cost function. \cite{Marden2013}\cite{Dijk2016} 

\subsubsection{Cost Function}
The cost function depends on two variables: a normalized power and a normalized load variable. To achieve the optimal yaw and axial induction settings a mixed-objective cost function is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
J(P,DEL) = c*((P_{ref}-P(a_i,\gamma_i))/P_{bw})^2  + \\
(1-c)*DEL(a_i,\gamma_i)/DEL_{base}
\end{aligned}
 \label{eq:costf}
\end{equation}
Where $c$ is the tuning parameter for the optimization between power and loads and $P_{ref}$ is the desired power output of the wind farm. $P_{bw}$ and $DEL_{base}$ are the power and loads baselines respectively, to create normalized variables.
\newline
To execute the optimization, the cost function has to be minimized. To obtain power production close to the reference, the power part of the cost function is a quadratic difference. As a result values much larger than the reference are heavily penalized, whereas the power crosses $P_{bw}$ the emphasis shifts to the loads.

\subsubsection{Game Theory}
The game-theoretic approach uses random perturbations for the yaw angles and the axial induction to optimize the cost function. When new values for yaw and axial induction settings give an improvement regarding the cost function, the settings are saved and the process will be repeated with the new settings. Because of the fact it uses random perturbations, the game theoretic approach is an adequate optimizer to find the global minimum of the cost function.\cite{Dijk2016}
