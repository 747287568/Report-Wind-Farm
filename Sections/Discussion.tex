What have we done and how to interpret the results
\subsection{Conclusion}
Power reduction by axial  induction and yaw control will lead to a reduction in the loads on the wind farm. 
 

\subsection{Discussion \& Recommendations}
This paper, which presents the results of a multi-objective wind farm optimization through yaw control and axial induction control is bound to a number of limitations. Below, these are discussed and recommendations for future work are given.
\begin{itemize}
	\item During optimization, loads that are introduced by varying the axial induction factor of a turbine are not considered. This can change the outcome of the optimization. To resolve this issue, additional loads caused by varying the axial induction factor can be investigated and stored in the lookup table.
	\item For the flow field, two recommendations can be given. FAST calculates the loads on the turbine based on a modeled flow field which does not take turbulence effects of the wake into account. Added turbulence effects can change the results of the optimization and should, as such, be included in future work. The shear constant was set for a flat ocean ground surface. To allow optimization for a wider range, different shear constants can be added to the lookup table.
	\item While loads reduction is achieved, the cost function does not completely converge to a global minimum. This could be investigated in future work.
	\item 
\end{itemize}

  
%	\item Linear interpolation out of the LUT is used to calculate the DEL values for intermediate parameter values. This can lead to a deviation in DEL values with respect to a direct calculation. For one range of calculations of the LUT some extreme values occur. These values have been smoothed. However, these values lay out of the scope of the optimization problem so it had not an effect on the optimization at all.
