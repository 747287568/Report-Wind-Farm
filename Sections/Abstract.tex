	\noindent With wind energy gaining importance on the energy marked, are aspects such as optimal usage of resources as well as reliability and stability of a growing importance. Nowadays, more and more of the wind energy is generated in large wind farms. These farms have the advantages of being cheaper in installation as well as maintenance. However, the current control method(greedy control) is far from optimal, and only takes power into account. This paper combines the use of 2 other types of control methods (yaw and axial induction control) to find the optimal running procedure of a wind farm. Decreasing the damaging loads on the turbines, while better regulating the power output. Making wind energy cheaper while at the same time increasing its stability. Ensuring that wind energy is ready for the future.
