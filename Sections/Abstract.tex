	\noindent With wind energy gaining importane on the energy marked, wordt optimaal gebruikmaken van de beschikbare resorces, zowel als betrouwbaarheid en stabielitijd van steeds groter belang. Nowadays, more and more of the wind energy is generated in windfarms. These farms have the advantages of beeing cheaper in instalation aswell as maintanance. However, the currend controll method(gready controll) is far from optimal, and only takes power into account. This paper combines the use of 2 other types of controll methods (yaw and axial induction controll) to find the optimal running procedure of a windfarm. Decresing the damaging loads on the turbines, while beter regulating the poweroutput. At the same time making wind energy cheaper aswell as increasing its stabillitie. Making windenergy ready for the future.
