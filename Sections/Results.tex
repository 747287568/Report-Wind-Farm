\section{Results}

This chapter shall discribe, compare and evaluate the results of 3 optimalisation cases. The first case is used to determine the maximum power output that this 9 turbine farm can extract from the previousely described windconditions, this case neglects the loads. the other 2 cases shall then be run to find the optimum running procedure when aiming for a refference power of 80 and 60 persent of the maximum power production. 

Figures, tables with results and explanation:
   
	1- realistic run to find the max power that this setup can extract from these wind conditions

	2- realistic run at 80 percent of the max? 
	
	3- realistic run at 60 percent of the max? 

  		-comparing these to echother
    	-showing that the power does indeed aproach te ref power
    	-comparing the loads, how do those relate to reduction of the ref power
  		-noting the percentual(?) reduction in loads (in comparison to a base?)
 
-------------------------------------------
  
-- iterations
-- 0 ref power
-- ref power above max power  
-- bandwith
       -jurriaan? experimenting with relevance 
-- optimalisation factor 
       -only loads?
       -only power?
