\section{Results}

Figures, tables with results and explanation.

the aimed outputs are the optimal variable settings of yaw and axial induction, at which the DELs are minimised for a set power output.

as discused in the capter on optimalisation, is the optimalisation caracterised by certine input settings. a better understanding of the optimalisation can be achived(?) by experimenting with these settings. this chapter will show some of the more significant cases.
-------------------------------------------
- a realistic run ( 4MW ?)

- one with a ref power above the max, making it also optimize for power

-one extreme(0 power), validation the optimalisation methode for the extremes, relating it to the axial induction?

-one with more/less iterations, evaluating accuracy and computation time.
  
-- bandwith
       -jurriaan? experimenting with relevance 
-- optimalisation factor 
       -only loads?
       -only power?
