\section{Results}

This chapter shall discribe, compare and evaluate the results of 3 optimalisation cases. (more info/intro?)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Maximum power production
	\item Power production at 80 percent 
	\item Power production at 60 percent 
\end{itemize}
The first case is used to determine the maximum power output that this 9 turbine farm can extract from the previousely described windconditions, this case neglects the loads. The other 2 cases will then be run to find the optimum running procedure when aiming for a refference power of 80 and 60 persent of the maximum power production as gathered in the first case.

 \subsection{case 1}
 1- realistic run to find the max power that this setup can extract from these wind conditions
 
 \subsection{case 2}
 2- realistic run at 80 percent of the max?
 
 \subsection{case 3}
 3- realistic run at 60 percent of the max?

Figures, tables with results and explanation:
   
 

  		-comparing these to echother
    	-showing that the power does indeed aproach te ref power
    	-comparing the loads, how do those relate to reduction of the ref power
  		-noting the percentual(?) reduction in loads (in comparison to a base?)
