\section{Conclusion}
This paper shows a model that regulates power while minimizing loads. This is done by yaw and axial induction control. It is shown that power tracking for the tested simulations stays within $10^{-4}\%$ range of the reference power. While tracking the reference power, the loads were significantly reduced.
Through reference tracking a load reduction of at least 25\% can be achieved.
 
A lookup table is created which contains DEL values that shows the effect of yaw misalignment on the yawed turbine. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:LUTsliceC2C} yawing has a significant effect on the loads of the turbine.

It can be concluded that the presented model is suitable for power regulation and loads minimization.
